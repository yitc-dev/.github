# yitc

## Releases

**v2.0.0** — released 2026-09-05.

### Trust anchor

Every yitc release is signed. The trust root is anchored on this key fingerprint, published
**here** — on a channel independent of the release mirror, because the mirror cannot vouch
for itself:

```
SHA256:fxSmnOxwlztBxmGq5ckGI+Xg9XKMfE33WBXeCnrhikY
```

Pin it by hand at first install and verify against it before anything is written.

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/yitc-dev/yitc yitc
yitc/bin/yitc-v2 release verify yitc --anchor SHA256:fxSmnOxwlztBxmGq5ckGI+Xg9XKMfE33WBXeCnrhikY
yitc/bin/yitc-v2 release install yitc --into <target-dir> --anchor SHA256:fxSmnOxwlztBxmGq5ckGI+Xg9XKMfE33WBXeCnrhikY
```

`release verify` writes nothing under any outcome — it is the gate. `release install` runs that
same gate to a verdict before the target directory is opened, so a refused install leaves the
destination byte-identical. A tampered artifact, a tampered trust root and a revoked signing key
are each refused by name.
